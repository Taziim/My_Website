      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Hey! I'm Abdul Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early age,
        and been passionate about it ever since. I really liked to build stuff
        using no-code tools back in 2010, and from that, I explored how to code
        myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages and
        technologies, and had the privilege to worked in a Recruitment Company
        and a SaaS Company I'm interested in building something awesome with
        code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile
        Development, Open Source and Competitive Programming When I'm not coding
        I play games with my friends, watch some show on Netflix, or if the
        weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
